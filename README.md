[Dev](./dev/README.md) 
----------------------

Playbook for MacOS or Ubuntu computer used for programming.
It contains sensible defaults and pretty layout for shell and Emacs along with needed software. 

In case where I'm setting Mac to be my dev machine, it tends to be my main computer also so it has few apps that are not strictly development-oriented. If you want to make use of it check list of installed software and remove all unnecessary apps.

TODO: Add playbooks for other purposes.
